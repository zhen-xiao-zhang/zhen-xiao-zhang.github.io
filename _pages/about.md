<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently (Sep. 2024) a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at San Antonio, advised by <a href='https://yanmingong.github.io'>Dr. Yanmin Gong</a>.

My research interests include Cybersecurity, Foundation Models, Edge Intelligence, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. 
<!-- I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->
